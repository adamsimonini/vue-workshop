      <h2>What Is Vue?</h2>
      <p>
          Vue.js is a Javascript framework. Frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue enable developers to
          place javascript logic into webpages in an organized, powerful, and performant way. In other words,
          with these frameworks you can get routing, event listeners, dynamic content generation, and more from 
          front-end code (and with fewer lines of code).
      </p>
      <p>
          These frameworks focus on components and state.
          <ul>
              <li>components are re-usable bundles of code, which for our purposes will equal .vue files</li>
              <li>state refers to the data contained within each component, and the all as a whole, at a given point in time</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
  </div>
